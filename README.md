This plugin aims at providing a functional and usable `coqidetop` wrapper for use with Kakoune.

-----------------

P.S.: [coqoune](https://github.com/guest0x0/coqoune) is the same kind of project, and was started way before this one.
However, in my experience, Coqoune has been a bit buggy at some times (for example crashing on Coq errors), and the overall integration with highlighters doesn't work that well.
I wanted to maintain a fork on my own, but most of the extension is written in some weird non-POSIX shell, which I'm not that familiar with at all.

I chose to write the “backend” in Rust, mainly to discover, and because I felt like it was more suited for this than Haskell.
